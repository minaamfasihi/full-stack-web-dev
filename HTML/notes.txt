Block Level Elements:
- Always start on new line
- Takes up full available width
e.g: <div>, <h1> - <h6>, <p>, <form>

Inline Level Elements:
- Doesnt start on a new line
- Takes only width as necessary

e.g: <span>, <a>, <img>

- Between two paragraphs, there is a padding of 10px. You can change that from CSS.
